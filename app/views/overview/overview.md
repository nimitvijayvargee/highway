# Overview

### Welcome to the **Highway** to **Undercity**, an unforgettable summer of hardware running from now through July 31st.

If you've *never* done hardware before, this is *your* opportunity to get started. That one project you saw on YouTube but had no idea how to build? *That ends now.*

**Earn points with each project you build.** Collect prizes along the way. Join your friends at Undercity, a 4 day hackathon in San Francisco at GitHub HQ.

*Don't forget to join the Hack Club Slack, our community. Need an invite? Enter your email on the [landing](/)!*

## Here's how it works:
---
### 1. Build hardware projects

Design custom projects. [Submit](/advanced/submitting) them. Get approved. Receive a credit card of up to $350 USD. Buy the parts and build it. Repeat

There's three tiers:

- **Tier 3:** get 4 points, up to $50 USD
- **Tier 2:** get 6 points, up to $150 USD
- **Tier 1:** get 10 points, up to $350 USD

Each tier has progressively harder guidelines. Check out the [Custom projects](/advanced) tab for all the info you need - including project guidelines!


Head on over to the [custom projects](/advanced) are fully self-directed! You'll be responsible for all the research, and in return, you'll get a debit card of up to $350* USD to spend on your project! *You must journal your progress while working on custom projects*

*You can make an unlimited amount of projects, so get building!*

**If you're a complete beginner, head on over to check out our [starter projects](/getting-started/starter-projects)! They're designed to help you get jumpstarted**

### 2. Join weekly events

Every week, we'll host events like Speedruns, Game Nights, AMAs, and Showcases! 

See the [Events](/events) tab for an up-to-date list.

### 3. Get invited to Undercity

Once you collect 4 points, AND you've physically built 1 project, you'll get invited to [Undercity](/getting-started/undercity), a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ from July 11-14.

It'll be filled to the *brim* with hardware - hundreds of microcontrollers, kilometers of cabling, and more 3D printing than you could ever need. (Did someone mention a PCB mill?)

## Ready. Set. Build!

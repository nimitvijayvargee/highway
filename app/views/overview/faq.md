# FAQ

Welcome to the FAQ! This page attempts to point you to the right place when you have a question. It'll be constantly updated throughout the event as more questions get asked!

As always, if *anything* is unclear, ask in #highway for help!

### When is the last day to submit a project design?
July 31st, 2025.

### When is the last day to get enough points to qualify for Undercity?
July 10th, 2025

### What's the difference between hackpad and a 4-point starter project?
With hackpad, we source all the parts for you and send you a kit. With a 4-point starter, you have to find where to get all the components yourself

### When is the last day to submit a completed build to be reimbursed for undercity?
August 7th, 2025. Hard deadline.

### How can I get started with a custom project?
Read the [custom projects](/advanced) tab carefully. Everything is there.

### How are hours tracked?
Journaling! Every time you work on a project, you'll need to log what you did

### How will I get my 3D printed parts?
Through **printing legion**! It's an international network of Hack Clubbers 3D printing for each other, sponsored by Polymaker (website coming soon - hang tight!)

### How likely is it that my project will be approved?

It's hard to say without seeing your project, but generally speaking, as long as you follow the guidelines on the submitting page for your project then you'll more likely than not get approved:

- Custom projects: https://highway.hackclub.com/advanced/submitting
- Hackpad: https://hackpad.hackclub.com/submitting

If you get rejected, don't fret! Edit your project, ask your peers in #highway for help, and then resubmit - most mistakes are very easy to fix

There is absolutely *no* limit to the number of projects we can accept - the more the better!

### How many projects can I make?

As many as you want! The funding is also *per* project, not per person. 

### Are group projects allowed for Highway?

Groups are allowed! Here's the deal though:

- Each person must journal and indicate what they did and how they contributed
- Your grant is **per project**, not per person - even if you have 10 people, you're stuck with a max of 350 USD
- Points are split evenly among all of you, no exceptions.

There is no cap to the number of people you can have on a project, however in general I *strongly* advise against having more than 2 people on a project. There's a lot of diminishing returns and unclear lines of responsibility that make it difficult to actually build the project.

### Can I submit an existing project I made?

If it's already finished, unfortunately not, sorry! Start a new project

If you've just started/are in the middle of designing, you need to have journaled the entire process beforehand

If you're almost done designing, unfortunately not

### What's the minimum complexity for a custom project?

Check out the [Project Guidelines](/advanced/project-guidelines) in the Custom Projects section!

### Can I do Highway, but not go to Undercity?

Yup! This is for everyone, irrespective of whether or not they can come to Undercity.

(You should still totally come if you can though!)

### Can points be used for something else?

Not as of right now. There are additional rewards for those who get *above* 12 points though. Check out the [point system](/getting-started/point-system) tab for more information on that.

### What if my project costs more than $350? Can I pay for the difference myself?

Yes!

### Can I use my hours for Summer of Making

No! Double-dipping is not allowed.

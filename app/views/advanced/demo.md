# Submitting your physical build!

Finished building your project? Awesome! Here's everything you need to do:

---

### 1. Update your GitHub repo

Once you've built your project, make sure your GitHub repository is up to date! You should add in the following:

- Any files you've updated since (3D printed parts, schematics, firmware, etc)
- A picture of your project in the README.md

### 2. Record a video demo!

Next, record a quick 1-minute video of what your project is, what it does, and how it works! It doesn't need to be super edited or professional - a recording from your phone works fine

Post it on YouTube afterwards - it can be unlisted if you'd like.

### 3. Share your project online

Share your project online! Reddit is *heavily* preferred, but Printables is also fine if your project has 3D printed parts with it too.

An example post is [@Cyao's Icepi Zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1kwx5p7/i_built_the_fpga_raspberry_pi_zero_equivalent/) - he's a 17-year old Hack Clubber from France!

We would also REALLY appreciate it if you could plug Hack Club!!! No pressure though - just helps to spread the word :)

### 4. Make a magazine page!

We're making a Highway to Undercity magazine! Vol 1 has already been printed, but we're making a Vol 2 that'll be bigger and better. In the past two weeks, Vol 1 has been given out to Michael Reeves, Strange Parts, lots of large companies, and more - we're planning on going even bigger than that!

What's new with Vol 2?

- You must include at least 1 picture of the physically built project
- We're including Undercity moments too!

Got questions? Ping @acon on slack!

*this step is optional*

### 5. Fill out the form!

Once you've done all of that, fill out the following form! You'll get an email once approved w/ instructions on how to get your flight reimbursement, if you need one.

Swag will be mailed out, please do not ask for tracking until after Highway is over.

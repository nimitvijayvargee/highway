## Requirements

Generally speaking, all you need is a [shipped project](/advanced/shipping). The following requirments are the bare minimum, but you're encouraged to go above and beyond! Add a 3D render, custom logo, and more!

Before submitting, please *absolutely* make sure of the following:

**Your project has a journal in the [gallery](/projects)**

### YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY CONTAINS ALL OF YOUR PROJECT FILES:

- [x] the source files for your PCB, if you have one (.kicad\_pro, .kicad\_sch, gerbers.zip, etc)
- [x] **A .STEP file of your project's 3D CAD model (and ideally the source design file format as well - .f3d, .FCStd, etc)**
- [x] ANY other files that are part of your project (firmware, libraries, references, etc)

*if you're missing a .STEP file with all of your electronics and CAD, your project will not be approved*

### YOUR JOURNAL.md FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:
